# macOS set-up @todo items

1. Install NVM?
2. _VirtualBox_ requires allowing Oracle America as a trusted developer in `macOS` security settings
   - Detect VirtualBox in casks file, ask to skip? Would give script a chance to complete before trying
3. Add SSH key generation step
    - Add key copy command to `.zshrc` alias list
4. Add developer fonts
5. Add directories:
    - Repos
    - VirtualMachines
6. See if installation of brews & casks can detect presence of checksum?
7. Sort out traps
