# macOS set-up @todo items

1. _VirtualBox_ requires allowing Oracle America as a trusted developer in `macOS` security settings
   - Detect VirtualBox in casks file, ask to skip? Would give script a chance to complete before trying
2. Add SSH key generation step
    - Add key copy command to `.zshrc` alias list
3. Add directories:
    - Repos
    - VirtualMachines
4. See if installation of brews & casks can detect presence of checksum?
5. Add `mas outdated` and `mas upgrade` commands on secondary run to update anything outstanding from Apple App Store
5. Sort out traps
